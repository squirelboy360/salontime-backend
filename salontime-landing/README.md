# SalonTime landing page

Landing page for SalonTime: coming soon to the App Store and Play Store. Uses the same design language as the app (white, black, orange, grey, rounded cards).

## Using your screenshots

The three iPhone frames on the page use these image files. **Replace them with your own app screenshots** so the landing page shows the real app:

| Section        | File to use                          | Save as                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Owner dashboard| Your salon owner dashboard screenshot| `images/owner-dashboard.png` |
| Client app     | Your client search / nearby salons   | `images/client-app.png`     |
| Salon details  | Your salon profile / services screen | `images/salon-details.png`  |

1. Save your three screenshots (the ones you attached) into the `images/` folder.
2. Name them exactly: `owner-dashboard.png`, `client-app.png`, `salon-details.png`.

The page will then display your real app in the iPhone frames.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or:

```bash
cd salontime-landing
npx serve .
```

Then open the URL shown (e.g. http://localhost:3000).
